        <h1>History of Seattle</h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>
            Seattle lies on a narrow strip of land between the salt waters of Puget Sound and the fresh waters of Lake
            Washington. Beyond the waters lie two rugged mountain ranges, the Olympics to the west and the Cascades to the
            east. It is a city built on hills and around water, in a mild marine climate that encourages prolific vegetation
            and abundant natural resources.

        <h2>Indigenous People</h2>
        <p>
            The city is built on Indigenous land, the traditional territory of Coast Salish peoples, specifically the
            Suquamish and Duwamish Tribes. They lived in the region for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans
            or white settlers and developed extensive trade and social networks, along with a deep knowledge of the land and
            sea, and continue to live here today.
        </p>

        <h2>Settlers</h2>
        <p>
            White settlers came to the Seattle area in 1851, establishing a townsite they first called New York, and then,
            adding a word from the Chinook jargon meaning "by-and-by," New York-Alki. They soon moved a short distance
            across Elliott Bay to what is now the historic Pioneer Square district, where a protected deep-water harbor was
            available. This village was soon named Seattle, honoring the Duwamish Indian leader named Sealth.

        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p>
            The new town's principal economic support was Henry Yesler's lumber mill at the foot of Mill Street (now Yesler
            Way), built in 1853. Much of the mill's production went to the booming city of San Francisco, but the mill also
            supplied the fledgling towns throughout the Puget Sound region. A first failed attempt at incorporation lasted
            from 1865 to 1867. The official incorporation of Seattle was by the Territorial legislature on December 2, 1869;
            Seattle had more than 2,000 residents. Washington would not become the 42nd state until 20 years later in 1889.
        </p>

        <h2>Railroads</h2>
        <p>
            In the early 1870s the Northern Pacific Railway Company announced that its transcontinental railroad western
            terminus would be at Tacoma, some forty miles south of Seattle. Despite local leaders' disappointment, Seattle
            managed to force a connection with Northern Pacific shortly after its completion in 1883, and the town's
            population soared in the late 1880s. Lumber and coal were the primary industries, but the growth of fishing,
            wholesale trade, shipbuilding, and shipping also contributed to the town's economic expansion and population
            growth. One estimate is that in the first half of 1889, Seattle was gaining 1,000 new residents per month; in
            March alone, there were 500 buildings under construction, most of them built of wood. The explosive growth was
            slowed but not stopped by a devastating fire on June 6, 1889, which leveled the buildings on 116 acres in the
            heart of the city's business district. No one died in the fire, but the property damage ran into millions of
            dollars.

        <h2>Fires</h2>
        <p>
            Enthusiasm for Seattle was little dampened by the fire. In fact, it provided the opportunity for extensive
            municipal improvements, including widened and regraded streets, a professional fire department, reconstructed
            wharves, and municipal water works. New construction in the burned district was required to be of brick or
            steel, and it was by choice on a grander and more imposing scale. Explore documents in the Archives relating to
            the Great Fire here.
