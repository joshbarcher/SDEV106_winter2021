            Halo is a titan of the gaming world. The series nearly single handedly launched and established Microsoft in
            the gaming world with their new console, the Xbox. Rivaled only by Gears of War, it exists as the Xbox’
            crowning IP. From the game’s release to today, the history of Halo is a telling of a relatively new series
            becoming larger than most. A lot of games date back to the 80s and 90s, but this relatively new game series
            is as young as it is influential. With a new Halo game on its way, it seems like a great time to review the
            history of Halo and its impact on the gaming world.

            The history of Halo and its series starts, in a way, in the past. In the game, a race of advanced aliens
            called the Forerunners slowly built a vast empire in space. That empire included the Milky Way galaxy, as
            well as over three million fertile worlds around the universe. The Forerunners saw their role in the galaxy
            as the architects of advancing all races. Before them, the Precursors played the same role, ensuring
            stability as best they could across the galaxies. The Forerunners believed there would come a time that they
            would need to pass their duty down to the next race. They believed that race would be humans.
