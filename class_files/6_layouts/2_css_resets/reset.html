        <h1>Eric Meyer's "Reset CSS" 2.0</h1>
        <p>
            One of the pioneers of the CSS Reset method, Eric Meyer,
            created a Reset stylesheet that is still in use on
            millions of websites today. Most people use it in its
            unedited form, despite Meyer’s recommendation against
            this:
        </p>

        <p>The reset styles given here are intentionally very generic.
            There isn’t any default color or background set for the
            body element, for example. I don’t particularly recommend
            that you just use this in its unaltered state in your own
            projects. It should be tweaked, edited, extended, and
            otherwise tuned to match your specific reset baseline.
            Fill in your preferred colors for the page, links, and
            so on.
        </p>
