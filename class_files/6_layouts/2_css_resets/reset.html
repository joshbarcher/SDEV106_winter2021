    <h1>Eric Meyer's "Reset CSS" 2.0</h1>
    <p>
        One of the pioneers of the CSS Reset method, Eric Meyer,
        created a Reset stylesheet that is still in use on
        millions of websites today. Most people use it in its
        unedited form, despite Meyer’s recommendation against
        this:
    </p>

    <p>The reset styles given here are intentionally very generic.
        There isn’t any default color or background set for the
        body element, for example. I don’t particularly recommend
        that you just use this in its unaltered state in your own
        projects. It should be tweaked, edited, extended, and
        otherwise tuned to match your specific reset baseline.
        Fill in your preferred colors for the page, links, and
        so on.
    </p>
