                <p>As European explorers began to ‘discover’ the Pacific Northwest in the latter half of the 18th century, they
                    came to a land that was already inhabited by American Indian tribes. In the area around what is today Mount
                    Rainier National Park, the Nisqually, Puyallup, Squaxin Island, Muckleshoot, Yakama, and Cowlitz tribes all
                    used the natural resources surrounding the mountain they called “Takhoma.”</p>
                <p>Archaeological evidence traces
                    native use of the area back 9,000 years. For millennia, the ancestors of modern tribes came to the mountain
                    seasonally to hunt and gather resources. Today, those tribes continue to maintain a deep connection to the
                    mountain.</p>

                <img id="visitors" src="images/history_2.jpg">
                <p>The mountain captivated early European and American visitors. Captain George Vancouver of the British Royal
                    Navy observed the mountain while surveying the Pacific coast in 1792 and decided to name the mountain after
                    his friend, Rear Admiral Peter Rainier. Mountaineers made some of the first non-native incursions on land,
                    eager to summit the iconic peak. P.B. Van Trump and his friend General Hazard Stevens made the first
                    recorded climb of the mountain in 1870 and others would soon follow.</p>
                <p>In 1883 James Longmire, on his way down
                    from summiting the mountain, found a mineral spring and opened a hotel and spa there not long after. The
                    entrepreneurial spirit and scenic appreciation for the mountain that drove Longmire would emerge as key
                    themes in the future development of Mount Rainier National Park.</p>

                <h2>Creation of the park</h2>
                <img src="images/history_4.jpg">
                <p>A wide variety of groups came together to help establish the park in 1899. Scientists, mountaineers,
                    conservation groups, local businesses, and large railroad companies all saw some possible benefit from a
                    national park around Mount Rainier. They combined their often disparate interests into a lobbying campaign
                    starting in 1893. It stressed the potential for tourism from the nearby cities of Seattle and Tacoma, the
                    unsuitability of land for other commercial purposes like agriculture, grazing, or mining, and a need to
                    preserve the unique glacial landscape for further study. After hesitant congressmen received assurances that
                    the park would not come as an added expense to the government, the bill passed in 1899. Mount Rainier became
                    the nation’s fifth national park and the first to be established after the Forest Reserve Act of 1891 that
                    created the U.S. Forest Service. This resolved any questions as to whether the nascent national park and
                    national forest systems would be administered as separate entities with different objectives.</p>

                <p>Development at the park grew at a torrid and often chaotic pace. Visitation ballooned from 1,786 in 1906 to
                    34,814 nine years later and park administrators struggled to keep up with the constant demand for more
                    roads, lodging, and other services. The advent of automobiles increased the accessibility of the park but
                    also created new challenges.</p>

                <p>Mount Rainier was the first national park to allow cars and by the time a road
                    was built to Paradise Park in 1910, one third of the ranger force was being used for traffic control.
                    Concurrent with the growth in tourist activity was an increased commercial interest in the natural resources
                    of the park. During the first fifteen years of the park’s existence and in the absence of established
                    regulations, mining, water development, and timber schemes sprang up but met with limited success.</p>

                <h2>1916-1930</h2>
                <img src="images/history_6.jpg">
                <p>The creation of the National Park Service in 1916 brought significant changes to Mount Rainier. A
                    professional ranger force began to take on a greater role in managing the park, including starting
                    interpretive programs in 1921. This early period before the Great Depression was also key for the
                    development of park infrastructure. The Paradise Inn was opened in 1917 and plans to develop Sunrise were
                    crafted throughout the 1920s. Road construction reached its peak with all of the roads in the park being
                    built or surveyed by 1930. These changes stimulated a larger debate that continues to this day over the
                    degree certain areas should be developed or left as primitive wilderness.</p>
