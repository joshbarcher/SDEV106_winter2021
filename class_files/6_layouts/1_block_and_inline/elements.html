        <h1>Basic document flow</h1>

        <p>I am a basic block level
            element. My adjacent block
            level elements sit on new
            lines below me.</p>

        <p>By default we span 100% of
            the width of our parent
            element, and we are as
            tall as our child content...</p>

        <p>We are separated by our
            margins. Because of margin
            collapsing, we are
            separated by the width of
            one of our margins, not
            both.</p>

        <p>inline elements <span>like
            this one</span> and <span>this
            one</span>sit on the same
            line as one another, and
            adjacent text nodes, if
            there is space on the same
            line. ...</p>
