            <h1>Seattle Mariners History</h1>

            <p>Seattle Mariners, American professional baseball team based in Seattle that plays in the American League
            (AL). The Mariners were founded in 1977 and posted losing records until 1991 (an all-time mark for the
            longest period before a franchise’s first winning season). The team is the only current major-league
            organization to have never played in the World Series.</p>

            <p>Seattle had previously been home to a Major League Baseball franchise for one year in 1969, and when that
            team—the Pilots, now the Milwaukee Brewers—relocated, local governments sued the AL for damages. In 1976 the
            league promised an expansion franchise in return for dropping the suit, and the Mariners joined the league
            alongside the Toronto Blue Jays the next year. The early Mariner teams, featuring players such as 1984 AL
            Rookie of the Year Alvin Davis and two-time All-Star second baseman Harold Reynolds, struggled mightily and
            routinely finished near the bottom of the divisional standings.</p>

            <p>The team’s slow turnaround to respectability had its roots in the debut of centre fielder Ken Griffey, Jr.,
            in 1989. Griffey quickly became the biggest star in the sport, and his ascendance sent fans to the ballpark
            and made the Mariners competitive. He joined with designated hitter Edgar Martinez, pitcher Randy Johnson,
            and right fielder Jay Buhner to lead Seattle to winning seasons in 1991 and 1993, but a postseason
            appearance eluded the team until 1995. That year, with the team threatened with relocation because of its
            substandard stadium and declining attendance, the Mariners rallied from an 111/2-game deficit to the Anaheim
            Angels with six weeks left in the regular season to win the AL Western division title. In the first round of
            the playoffs, the Mariners staged a similarly dramatic comeback against the New York Yankees: they won the
            five-game series after having trailed two games to none, with Martinez hitting a two-run series-winning
            double in the 11th inning of the final game. The team’s postseason run ended with a loss to the Cleveland
            Indians in the AL Championship Series (ALCS), but the renewed fan interest spurred county and state
            politicians to authorize the construction of a new baseball-only stadium, Safeco Field (which would open in
            1999). In 1996 shortstop Alex Rodriguez emerged as yet another superstar in the Seattle lineup, but these
            talent-laden Mariner teams made just one brief playoff appearance in the next four years.</p>
