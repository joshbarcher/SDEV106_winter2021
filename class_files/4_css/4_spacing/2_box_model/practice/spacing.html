                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                <p>1993 was a landmark year with the release of Mosaic,
                    credited as "the world's first popular browser".
                    Its innovative graphical interface made the World Wide
                    Web system easy to use and thus more accessible to the
                    average person. This, in turn, sparked the Internet boom
                    of the 1990s when the Web grew at a very rapid rate.
                    Marc Andreessen, the leader of the Mosaic team,
                    soon started his own company, Netscape, which released
                    the Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994.
                    Navigator quickly became the most popular browser.

                <p>Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading
                    to a browser war with Netscape. Microsoft was able to
                    gain a dominant position for two reasons: it bundled
                    Internet Explorer with its popular Microsoft Windows
                    operating system and did so as freeware with no
                    restrictions on usage. Eventually the market share
                    of Internet Explorer peaked at over 95% in 2002.

                <h2>Browser Wars</h2>
                <p>A browser war is competition for dominance in the usage
                    share of web browsers. The "First Browser War"
                    during the late 1990s pitted Microsoft's Internet Explorer
                    against Netscape's Navigator.[2] Browser wars
                    continued with the decline of Internet Explorer's market share
                    and the popularity of other browsers
                    including Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
                </p>

                <p>With the introduction of HTML5 and CSS 3, a new generation
                    of browser war began, this time adding extensive
                    client-side scripting to the World Wide Web, as well as more
                    widespread use of smartphones and other mobile
                    devices for browsing the web. These newcomers have ensured
                    that browser battles continue among enthusiasts,
                    while the average web user is less affected.
