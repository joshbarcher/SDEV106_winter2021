        <h1>An interesting paragraph</h1>

        <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs
            in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a
            paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
            coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is
            defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit.”
